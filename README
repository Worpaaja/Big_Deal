This is a copy of the repository used for Cartographia GameJam 2025

The team consisted of three people: amikko, Aleksi, and me.
The game was developed using pygame in the span of a weekend, some fixes were applied after the weekend(and the game is still a bit buggy).
The game was chosen by the jury as their favorite game.
